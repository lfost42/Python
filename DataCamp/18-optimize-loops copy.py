"""
A list of integers that represents each PokÃ©mon's generation has been loaded into your session called generations. You'd like to gather the counts of each generation and determine what percentage each generation accounts for out of the total count of integers.

The below loop was written to accomplish this task:

for gen,count in gen_counts.items():
    total_count = len(generations)
    gen_percent = round(count / total_count * 100, 2)
    print(
      'generation {}: count = {:3} percentage = {}'
      .format(gen, count, gen_percent)
    )
Let's make this loop more efficient by moving a one-time calculation outside the loop.
"""

# Import Counter
from collections import Counter

# Collect the count of each generation
gen_counts = Counter(generations)

# Improve for loop by moving one calculation above the loop
total_count = len(generations)

for gen,count in gen_counts.items():
    gen_percent = round(count / total_count * 100, 2)
    print('generation {}: count = {:3} percentage = {}'
          .format(gen, count, gen_percent))

# Collect all possible pairs using combinations()
possible_pairs = [*combinations(pokemon_types, 2)]

# Create an empty list called enumerated_tuples
enumerated_tuples = []

# Append each enumerated_pair_tuple to the empty list above
for i,pair in enumerate(possible_pairs, 1):
    enumerated_pair_tuple = (i,) + pair
    enumerated_tuples.append(enumerated_pair_tuple)

# Convert all tuples in enumerated_tuples to a list
enumerated_pairs = [*map(list, enumerated_tuples)]
print(enumerated_pairs)

#####
# Calculate the total HP avg and total HP standard deviation
hp_avg = hps.mean()
hp_std = hps.std()

# Use NumPy to eliminate the previous for loop
z_scores = (hps - hp_avg)/hp_std

# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]
#print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')

# Use list comprehension with the same logic as the highest_hp_pokemon code block
highest_hp_pokemon2 = [(name, hp, zscore) for name,hp,zscore in poke_zscores2 if zscore > 2]
#print(*highest_hp_pokemon2, sep='\n')
